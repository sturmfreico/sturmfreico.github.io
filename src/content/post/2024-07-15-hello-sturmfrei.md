We have officially opened our doors, and we are excited to transform the way online businesses operate with our finely crafted Shopify apps and innovative web tools.

### Our Story

Let us introduce ourselves: We’re Felix and Christoph, and together we are the founders of sturmfrei. Growing up in Hamburg, Germany, we developed a passion for technology and entrepreneurship at a young age. Our journey from tinkering with computers in our childhood home to launching a cutting-edge startup in one of the world's most vibrant cities has been nothing short of inspiring.

Felix has a background in business administration and marketing. With a degree from the University of Hamburg, he has a keen eye for market trends and a knack for identifying opportunities that others might overlook. Together, we form a formidable team, combining technical expertise with business acumen.

Christop brings a wealth of experience in software engineering and product development. After earning his degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Hamburg, he spent several years working with leading tech companies, honing his skills and gaining invaluable industry insights.

### Our Mission

At sturmfrei, our mission is simple yet ambitious: to empower e-commerce businesses by providing them with high-quality, user-friendly Shopify apps and web tools. We believe that by streamlining the online shopping experience, we can help businesses of all sizes thrive in an increasingly competitive market.

### The Name

The German word “sturmfrei” is often misunderstood due to its literal translation. It does not mean “storm-free” or “wind-free” as one might expect. Instead, sturmfrei refers to a situation where parents leave their children alone at home, giving them freedom to do as they please.

### Why Shopify?

Shopify has become a go-to platform for entrepreneurs looking to set up and manage online stores. However, despite its robust features, many businesses still face challenges when it comes to customization and optimization. This is where we come in. By developing finely crafted apps tailored to specific needs, we aim to fill the gaps and enhance the overall functionality of Shopify stores.
